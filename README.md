# DSI-Capstone
Capstone work submission for General Assembly Data Science Intensive programm


To run the project follow these instructions:

1. clone this repo 

2. `cd DSI-Capstone/`

3. create a virtual environment with pyhton 3 named 'env' (this part is very important):
create: `virtualenv -p python3 env`
activate: `source env/bin/activate`

4. install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. now to make jupyter notebook use our environment install it as a kernel:
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name env --display-name "ENV"`

6. open .ipynb files with Jupyter notebook and then select ENV from the kernel setting

7. run notebook. 


This repo has been tested on Linux and if those steps are followed correcly everything should work. I cannot vouch for Mac, and god forbid you try setting it up on Windows!
